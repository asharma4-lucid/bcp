# BCP

This is a python utility that allows users to interact with SQL Server's BCP utility natively in python.
It currently only supports MSSQL, but there are plans to support other database types in the future.
This library purposely requires nothing outside of the standard library, beyond testing and documentation needs. The
intention is to maintain this status.
